                <h3>Music (+ music videos)</h3>
                    <h4>Ung Kjærlighet</h4>
                        <p>I'm making a music video for my band's song. It has a lot of stop motion which I haven't started on yet, but it's fully storyboarded!</p>
                    <h4>Raphael</h4>
                        <p>A kinda sad song about Raph from ROTTMNT. What's left is rerecording the vocals and creating the music video.</p>
                    <h4>Donatello</h4>
                        <p>Also a sad song, but this one's about Donnie. I'm probably done writing it (unless I suddenly want to add more verses or something) but I haven't recorded it at all. I also don't have any ideas for the video yet.</p>
                    <h4>Leonardo</h4>
                        <p>Yes, I'm creating a song for each of the turtles. This one is in the excact same position as the Donnie song. How fitting lol</p>
                    <h4>Michelangelo</h4>
                        <p>I have the lyrics and chords down, just gotta record it (and find a way to change the tempo during the song because that's a part of the song for some reason (it's really cool though))</p>
                    <h4>ona li ike tawa mi</h4>
                        <p>I'm in the process of rerecording one of the first songs I uploaded to YouTube. I don't have any studio time until next year, but it's almost done!</p>

                <h3>Games</h3>
                <h4>Coddiwomple</h4>
                    <p>A game about five friends who (for the most part) haven't seen each other in a few years and decide to go on a road trip together. What could possibly go wrong?
                        <br>
                        <br>Total progress: 7% ish

                <h3>Fanfics</h3>
                    <h4>Powerless To Make It Stop</h4>
                        <p>A TMA fanfic about Jonathan Sims getting stressed and non-verbal and Martin Blackwood helps him as best as he can. Set in season 1 ish. I've begun writing it, but it's frustratingly hard to continue.</p>
                    <h4>I Can't Function Unless I'm the Only One Awake</h4>
                        <p>A TMA fanfic exploring Jonathan Sims' relationship to sleep, heavily inspired by my own experiences. It's barely been planned yet.</p>
